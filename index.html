    <p class="content">
      Every day that someone goes without tasting the godlike food that is Chicago Deep Dish Pizza, they spend it in a mindset separated from true food enlightenment. We seek to have spread our Chicago love to every corner of the world, would you like to help us?
    </p>
    <p class="content">
      Our core mission is to fight the lack of people who have yet to experience deep dish pizza and it is something we take very seriously. Since our non profit was founded in 2016, we have brought over 50,000 people to the light. This is only a small step in our goal and we are totally not trying to make deep dish the national pizza. We ask for you to join us in our fight and sign a petition to commit to our cause.
